# TrawlingDetection_Toolkit
The TrawlingDetection Toolbox takes processed and unprocessed MBES point cloud data in xyz, ping, beam format and calculates a zero mean surface which is used to detect all structures below and above a certain threshold. The detected structures are statistically analysed for each Gird cell within the EU standard Gird (EPSG:3035).
